<h3>Educational Texts</h3>
<p>Looking through the variety of AMMs and possible functions (this is a nice book as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Automated-Market-Makers-Decentralized-Cryptocurrency/dp/1484286154" target="_blank">reference</a>), I came across an AMM by <a href="https://dodoex.io/en" target="_blank">Dodo</a> that impressed me due to two features: (1) it is very versatile and tuneable and (2) it allows for single sided deposits. I worked out some features of the maths that were not very clear in their whitepaper. The document can be found <a href="https://github.com/lars-fritz/lars-fritz.github.io/raw/74dec685b932851f761d3dd54092477a9e6f40e3/documents/crypto/dodomath.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
