<h3>Topology in condensed matter systems</h3>

    <p>
        Topology plays a central role in condensed matter physics by describing properties of systems that remain 
        unchanged under continuous transformations, such as stretching or bending, as long as no tearing or breaking occurs. 
        This concept applies broadly across different phenomena, with <strong>topological defects</strong> and 
        <strong>topological insulators</strong> serving as two particular examples.
    </p>

        <strong>Topological defects</strong> are disruptions in ordered systems where the usual arrangement breaks down 
        in a controlled way. Examples include vortices in superconductors or dislocations in crystals, where the structure 
        cannot simply be undone by small changes. The stability of these defects is protected by the system’s topological 
        properties, making them robust features that cannot be easily removed.

        On the other hand, <strong>topological insulators</strong> are materials that, while insulating in the bulk, 
        conduct electricity along their surfaces or edges. The most famous example is the <strong>quantum Hall effect</strong>, 
        where electrons move in edge states that are immune to scattering by impurities or disorder. This edge conduction 
        is topologically protected, meaning it arises from the material’s overall structure, not the specifics of its 
        composition or defects.

        These are just two manifestations of topology in condensed matter systems. Topological phenomena provide profound 
        insights into the behavior of materials, leading to the discovery of exotic states of matter that are often immune 
        to disturbances which would disrupt more conventional materials.
