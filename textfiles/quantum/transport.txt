    <h3>Hydrodynamic transport in electronic systems</h3>

    <p>
        There are very few 'universal truths' in physics, but hydrodynamic behavior is one of them. The motion of any substance 
        at sufficiently high temperatures follows the laws of hydrodynamics. Originally, hydrodynamics described the viscous 
        motion of water, but its principles apply to a much broader range of settings: from the physics of stars and 
        interstellar matter to the magnetohydrodynamics of plasmas, and even the dynamics of soft active matter.

        Hydrodynamic principles are also encountered in applied disciplines, including engineering: ocean dynamics, weather 
        modeling, aviation, gas flow through pipes, and even traffic flow, to name a few examples. Remarkably, these principles 
        extend even to the physics of the early universe: at energies high enough to melt protons and neutrons, their constituent 
        quarks form the quark-gluon plasma. When a particle collider creates this state, it exists for only a fraction of a second, 
        but during that brief moment, it behaves according to the laws of fluid mechanics.

        The reason for this almost universal applicability lies in the underlying simplicity and generality of hydrodynamics. 
        The foundation of hydrodynamics is the relaxation of conserved quantities towards local equilibrium. These conserved 
        quantities are fundamental: mass, momentum, and energy (and charge in charged systems).

        In classical hydrodynamics, flow phenomena are described by a set of differential equations, including the continuity 
        equations and the <strong>Navier-Stokes equation</strong>. The role of the Navier-Stokes equation in fluid motion 
        is comparable to the linear Maxwell equations in electrodynamics. Together with appropriate boundary conditions, 
        these equations describe all aspects of viscous flow. While they are basic, they are non-linear, and solving them is 
        highly complex. In fact, proving some properties of their solutions is one of the seven <em>Millennium Prize Problems 
        in Mathematics</em>.

        A key characteristic of fluids is their viscosity: for example, water flows faster than honey due to its lower viscosity 
        despite having a similar density. Some classical fluids are so viscous that they appear solid. For instance, the viscosity 
        of pitch is \(10^{11}\) times that of water. In the quantum world, viscous liquids are found in strongly interacting 
        systems: the quark-gluon plasma is estimated to have a dynamic viscosity \(10^{16}\) times that of water, rivaling glass. 
        Interestingly, the ratio of dynamic viscosity to density in water and the quark-gluon plasma is comparable, as their densities 
        are enhanced by similar factors.

        In the context of condensed matter physics, hydrodynamics has a rich history of success. It is applied in the description 
        of strongly interacting one-dimensional systems, spin-excitations in insulators, and the dynamics near quantum critical points. 
        As a general rule, hydrodynamic behavior is most commonly encountered in strongly correlated systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Metals, on the other hand, fall into the category of weakly correlated systems. However, they are also the systems where 
        we most often talk about the 'flow' of charges and electrical currents. Until quite recently, this 'flow' was fundamentally 
        different from the flow of water, more resembling the erratic movement of balls on a tilted nail board, with nails in random 
        positions.
