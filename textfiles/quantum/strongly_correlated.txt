        By its very definition, the quantum many-body problem is strongly interacting. 
        When \(10^{24}\) particles come together in a tight space, they are organized at distances 
        comparable to the most elementary atomic length scale: the Bohr radius. As a result, 
        any problem in condensed matter physics begins as a strongly correlated problem where 
        many particles interact.

        Despite this inherent complexity, the concept of non-interacting particles has proven to 
        be a highly successful framework for describing a wide variety of systems, including 
        metals, topological insulators, and many others. This is due to a phenomenon known as 
        <strong>emergence</strong>: out of the interaction of many particles, a simpler 
        collective behavior can emerge.

        The field of strong correlations, however, deals with systems where such a simple 
        description does not exist â€” or, at least, has not yet been discovered.
