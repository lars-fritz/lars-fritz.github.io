        Throughout the last two years, it has become increasingly clear that DeFiâ€™s biggest problem to solve is loss-vs-rebalancing (LVR). LVR refers to the opportunity cost incurred by liquidity providers in automated market makers (AMMs) when compared to an ideal rebalancing strategy. It quantifies the difference between the value of the liquidity pool and the value that would have been achieved through perfect rebalancing of assets in response to price changes.

        In essence, LVR captures the losses that liquidity providers (LPers) experience due to price fluctuations and the resulting need for rebalancing. When prices move, LPers can find themselves holding assets that have decreased in value relative to their optimal positions. This situation becomes particularly critical during periods of high volatility, where the potential for loss increases significantly.

        The concept of LVR emphasizes the importance of timely and effective asset rebalancing. An ideal rebalancing strategy would dynamically adjust the composition of the liquidity pool to reflect current market conditions, maximizing the potential returns for LPers and minimizing their losses. Unfortunately, achieving this perfect rebalancing in real-time is a significant challenge due to market unpredictability and the inherent latency in transaction execution.
        To address the challenges posed by LVR, several innovative strategies can be employed:
        One effective approach is implementing a dynamic fee structure that adapts to market conditions. In scenarios of heightened volatility, increasing transaction fees can serve two main purposes: 
(i) By raising fees, the price accuracy can be slightly diminished, making it less attractive for arbitrageurs to exploit minor price discrepancies. This reduces the immediate losses faced by LPers; (ii) Higher fees during volatile periods can lead to greater revenue generation, which in turn can help offset the opportunity costs associated with LVR.

      <p> Recently, we started to look into the arbitrage dynamics of Uniswap v2 pools and how they get modified by fees. We find strong evidence for the usefulness of not only dynamical but also asymmetric fees. The results of our studies are available on the arxiv, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03976" target="_blank">Research Paper 1</a> and
