 <h3 id="market-makers">Market Makers and Automated Market Makers (AMMs)</h3>
      <div class="text-section">
        <p>In traditional financial markets, <strong>market makers</strong> play a vital role in ensuring liquidity. A market maker is a firm or individual who quotes both buy (bid) and sell (ask) prices for a financial asset, such as stocks or bonds, hoping to profit from the difference between the two. By continuously offering to buy or sell, market makers ensure there's always enough supply and demand, allowing smooth trading. They take on the risk of holding assets to provide this liquidity, and in return, they make profits on the spread (the difference between the bid and ask prices). Their role is crucial in stabilizing markets by preventing extreme price fluctuations and reducing the risk of illiquid markets.</p>

        <p>In the cryptocurrency world, <strong>Automated Market Makers (AMMs)</strong> attempt to replicate this role without the need for traditional intermediaries. AMMs are smart contracts that allow for decentralized trading by using liquidity pools instead of the traditional order book. In this system, users provide liquidity to pools for various cryptocurrency pairs, and the AMM uses an algorithm to set prices based on supply and demand. Popular platforms like Uniswap, Balancer, and SushiSwap employ AMMs to allow seamless trading in decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>

        <p>AMMs adjust prices according to a predefined algorithm. For example, Uniswap uses the formula <code>x * y = k</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the reserves of two tokens in a pool, and <code>k</code> is a constant. As more of one token is bought, its price increases to maintain the balance of the pool, emulating the function of a market maker by ensuring liquidity and price adjustment. This system eliminates the need for human intervention and enables 24/7 trading with lower overhead costs compared to traditional market-making systems.</p>

        <p>AMMs have revolutionized how liquidity is provided in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), allowing for trustless, permissionless trading while incentivizing users (liquidity providers) to supply liquidity by offering them transaction fees or rewards in the form of tokens.</p>

        <p>In summary, while traditional market makers stabilize financial markets by ensuring liquidity, the rise of AMMs in the cryptocurrency space has automated and decentralized this process, allowing anyone to participate in liquidity provision, thereby democratizing market-making.</p>
